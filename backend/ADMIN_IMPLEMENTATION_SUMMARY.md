# Admin Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds comprehensive admin functionality to the HepaPredict backend, allowing admin users to perform CRUD operations on users and predictions.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Database Models

#### Prediction Model (`models/Prediction.js`)
- Stores user predictions with all relevant data
- Links to users via ObjectId reference
- Includes symptoms, risk factors, prediction results, and metadata
- Indexed for efficient querying

#### Enhanced User Model
- Already had admin role support
- Now includes predictions array reference
- Maintains existing functionality

### 2. Admin Routes (`routes/admin.js`)

#### User Management
- `GET /api/admin/users` - Get all users with pagination and filtering
- `GET /api/admin/users/:id` - Get specific user by ID
- `POST /api/admin/users` - Create new user
- `PUT /api/admin/users/:id` - Update existing user
- `DELETE /api/admin/users/:id` - Delete user (with cascade delete for predictions)

#### Prediction Management
- `GET /api/admin/predictions` - Get all predictions with pagination and filtering
- `GET /api/admin/predictions/:id` - Get specific prediction by ID
- `PUT /api/admin/predictions/:id` - Update prediction (status, notes)
- `DELETE /api/admin/predictions/:id` - Delete prediction

#### Dashboard
- `GET /api/admin/dashboard` - Get system statistics and analytics

### 3. Enhanced Prediction System

#### Updated Prediction Endpoint
- Now requires authentication (`protect` middleware)
- Saves predictions to database
- Links predictions to users
- Returns prediction ID for reference

### 4. Security Features

#### Authorization Middleware
- `protect` - Verifies JWT token and loads user
- `authorize` - Checks user role (admin only for admin routes)
- All admin routes require both authentication and admin role

#### Data Protection
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Sensitive data is excluded from responses
- Input validation and sanitization

## API Endpoints Summary

### Admin-Only Endpoints

```
GET    /api/admin/dashboard           # System statistics
GET    /api/admin/users               # List users (with pagination/filtering)
GET    /api/admin/users/:id           # Get specific user
POST   /api/admin/users               # Create new user
PUT    /api/admin/users/:id           # Update user
DELETE /api/admin/users/:id           # Delete user
GET    /api/admin/predictions         # List predictions (with pagination/filtering)
GET    /api/admin/predictions/:id     # Get specific prediction
PUT    /api/admin/predictions/:id     # Update prediction
DELETE /api/admin/predictions/:id     # Delete prediction
```

### Enhanced Endpoints

```
POST   /api/predict                   # Now requires authentication and saves to DB
```

## Key Features

### 1. Pagination and Filtering
- All list endpoints support pagination (`page`, `limit`)
- User filtering by search term, role, and active status
- Prediction filtering by user ID, predicted class, and status

### 2. Comprehensive Data Management
- Full CRUD operations for users and predictions
- Cascade deletion (deleting user also deletes their predictions)
- Data validation and error handling

### 3. Dashboard Analytics
- Total users and predictions counts
- Active users and admin users counts
- Predictions by class distribution
- Recent activity (last 7 days)

### 4. Security and Validation
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based authorization
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling and logging

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Admin User
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "Admin",
    "lastName": "User",
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "role": "admin"
  }'
```

### Getting Dashboard Stats
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/admin/dashboard
```

### Managing Users
```bash
# Get all users
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/admin/users

# Create user
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe","email":"john@example.com","password":"password123"}' \
  http://localhost:5000/api/admin/users
```

## Testing

A comprehensive test script (`test_admin.js`) is included to verify all admin functionality:

```bash
node test_admin.js
```

## Documentation

- `README_ADMIN.md` - Complete API documentation
- `ADMIN_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary
- Inline code comments for all functions

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration** - Create admin dashboard UI
2. **Advanced Analytics** - Add more detailed reporting
3. **Audit Logging** - Track admin actions
4. **Bulk Operations** - Support for bulk user/prediction management
5. **Export Functionality** - Export data to CSV/Excel
6. **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket integration for live updates

## Security Considerations

1. **Rate Limiting** - Consider implementing rate limiting for admin endpoints
2. **Audit Trail** - Log all admin actions for security
3. **Data Encryption** - Consider encrypting sensitive prediction data
4. **Access Logs** - Monitor admin access patterns
5. **Backup Strategy** - Regular database backups for admin data
